    <p>Ashito is a fit teenage boy of fairly average height. He has curly, brown hair and brown eyes and is usually seen in his Esperion uniform when on the pitch, or in his school uniform or an Esperion jacket when off it.

Initially, Ashito is a brash and naive kid from a remote prefecture called Ehime. As an aspiring player who has dreams of becoming the world's greatest forward, his personality is considered self-centered and scoring focused, which can be defined by his playstyle when first joining Esperion. However, that is shattered quickly when not only is his position changed, Ashito realizes exactly how much he lacks in technique and football knowledge in comparison to the rest of his peers. But instead of falling into despair, he acknowledges his setbacks and asks anyone to help him move forward, showing his eagerness to learn and drive to better himself. This quality is admired by others, especially by fellow 1st year teammate Tachibana.

Ashito is stubborn, headstrong and refuses to go down without a fight, as shown when he gets into altercations with the promoted players Asari and Kuroda on the first day of school. As someone who loves football, he can get dangerously obsessed if not kept in check, as noted by others. This is especially prevalent in the Funabashi match when he tries to throw away his support system in order to reach a new height in football, discarding all notions of other people's concern for him. But as stated by his mother, Ashito is someone who also understands and needs people, in order for him to consistently outdo himself every time he is playing on the pitch. He has a high emotional intelligence as he strives to understand his teammates both in and outside of football.

Despite being a hard-headed and outwardly strong player, Ashito's character will crack when facing off against other players his age who are already world-class, possibly displaying a slight case of inferiority complex. However, as with all things related to football, he is not downed by adversity and is only thrilled to seek further challenges to force ever continuous improvement.</p>
